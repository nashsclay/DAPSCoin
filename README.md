Welcome to DAPS
=====================================


## Introduction

DAPScoin is a cutting edge cryptocurrency, with many features not available in most other cryptocurrencies.
- Anonymized transactions using Stealth addresses, RingCT and Bulletproofs.
- Masternode is secured with a collateral of 1,000,000 DAPS.
DAPS is a cryptocurrency designed for corporate entities, traders, and individuals to have the autonomy to transactions business freely around the world safely and securely without the exposure to malicious actors that threaten financial transactions through traceability.

DAPS is a privacy coin that aims to be the most private and secure privacy coin on the market in a hybrid chain of PoW, PoSv3 and PoA. We aim to set our protocol to become the new standard of privacy coins.

What makes DAPS special is that DAPS is the first to solve the "trust problem" for fully private chains with our PoA (Proof of Audit) algorithm which audits the chain for any abnormalities without compromising the chain's anonymity features.

DAPS is the world's first coin to implement Bulletproofs and RingCT & Ring Signatures in a staking chain. With DAPS it is possible to stake, run masternodes and mine PoA blocks. In 2019 DAPS completed two successful testnets, sponsored Consensus 2019 NYC and Futurist Conference in Canada, achieved and kept top 200 coin status, passed security audit by Red4Sec, launched mainnet and achieved over 3000 hosted masternodes in the first month, staying in the top 10.
